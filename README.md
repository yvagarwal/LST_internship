## 💼 Key Contributions  

- 📌 **Pose Estimation Annotation**  
  - Annotated human posture data using **DeepLabCut** to support research in gait and movement analysis.  
  - Implemented a pipeline to automate annotation using **MediaPipe** and human pose estimation, reducing processing time by over 80%.

- 📊 **Data Analysis & Visualization**  
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and anomalies in sensor data.

- 🧠 **Machine Learning Model Development**  
  - Created multiple models leveraging both video and sensor data streams to identify instances of **freezing of gait** in individuals.

- 📁 **Documentation & Reporting**  
  - Maintained clear documentation of workflows and contributed to internal reports for project tracking.
